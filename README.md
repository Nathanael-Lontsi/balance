# Scale balancing project
A scale balance is made up of two elements, the first being the two positive integer weights on a balance scale (left and right sides) and the second element being a list of available weights as positive integers. The objectif is to determine if the scale can be balanced using the least amount of weights from the list, but at most 2 weights only.
